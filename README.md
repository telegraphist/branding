# Telegraphist Branding

## The Telegraphist Design Palette

This design system is created from ham's for ham's to help teams build
high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.

### Page Color System

The color system is an organized approach to applying color to a UI. Global
color styles have semantic names and defined usage in components – primary,
secondary (brand colors), surface, background, and error.

Every color also has a complementary color used for elements placed “on” top of
it to promote consistency and accessible contrast. See the Telegraphist
[Page Color System][1].

### Typography

The Telegraphist Design type scale provides 18 typography styles for everything
from headlines to body text and captions. Each style has a clear meaning and
intended application within an interface.

Important attributes, such as the typeface, font weight, and letter case, can be
modified to match the brand and design. Take a look at the Telegraphist
[Typography][2].
