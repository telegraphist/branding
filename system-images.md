# System Images

We provides lots of images, representing common tasks and types of content for
use in navigation bars, tab bars, toolbars, and Home screen quick actions. It’s
a good idea to use these built-in images as much as possible because they´re
familiar to people.

## Use SVG Images

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a text-based graphics language that describes
images with vector shapes, text, and embedded raster graphics. SVG files provide
resolution independent, high resolution dots per inch (HiDPI) graphics on the
web, in print, and on mobile devices in a compact format. The ability to style
SVG with CSS and the support of scripting and animation makes SVG an integral
part of the web platform.

SVG is ideal for interactive, data-driven, personalized graphics. It is a
royalty-free, vendor neutral open standard developed under the W3C
([World Wide Web Consortium][1]) process, and widely supported by modern web
browsers.
